# Workplace for diffusion regulatory element design models

This repository contains code related to running diffusion models for regulatory element design on single cell data. This is a show repo, original is private and belongs to mkarikomi

Currently, the repo has 4 different models

All models reference and import original repos in the folder re_design located in the root folder of this repo

For reproduction, clone this repo and create re_design folder with the repo of interest.

The links and versions of original repos you can find below

## Directories
- [`benchmarks`](benchmarks/) ([readme](benchmarks/README.md)): scripts to run predictive and generative benchmarks on competing diffusion and supervised models on multiple single-cell datasets.
- [`classifier_diffusion`](classifier_diffusion/) : scripts run Classifier guided diffusion on single-cell data.
- [`data_preprocessing`](data_preprocessing/) : notebooks and scripts to create .csv files for training on ATAC or tCRE data
- [`dirichlet_diffusion`](dirichlet_diffusion/) ([readme](dirichlet_diffusion/README.md)): scripts to run Dirichlet diffusion models on single-cell data. 
- [`dna_diffusion`](dna_diffusion/) ([readme](dna_diffusion/README.md)): scripts to run DNA diffusion on single-cell data. 
- [`train_utils`](train_utils/) : scripts to preprocess csv files for training and validation
- [`universal_guidance`](universal_guidance/) : scripts to run Universal Guidance diffusion on single-cell data. Currently under construction
